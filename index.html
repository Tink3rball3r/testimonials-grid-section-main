					I received a job offer mid-course, and the

					“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the
					bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition
					and have heard some people who had an amazing
					experience here. I signed up for the free intro
					course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
					shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best
					- and most grueling - time of my life. Since
					completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
					careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
					startup. ”

					Such a life-changing experience. Highly

					“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written
					a line of code. I needed some structure from
					professionals who can help me learn programming
					step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
					former student of theirs who can only say
					wonderful things about the program. The entire
					curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
					very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
					assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
					was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
					level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
					In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
					interviews as an example of my developent
					experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
					full-stack developer after receiving multiple
					offers. 100% recommend! ”

					“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my
